# Go Practice: Real-World CLI Exercises

Welcome to Go Practice! This collection of hands-on exercises focuses on building practical CLI tools using Go's standard library. Each exercise is designed to teach you real-world skills while creating useful tools you might actually use.

## üéØ Learning Philosophy

Instead of abstract examples and toy functions, these exercises build complete, useful CLI applications. You'll learn Go by solving real problems and creating tools that have genuine utility.

## üìö Exercise Syllabus

| Exercise | Focus | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| [1. URL Downloader CLI Tool](./01-url-downloader/) | Command-line arguments, HTTP requests, File operations, Progress tracking, Error handling | Create a command-line tool that downloads files from URLs with progress indicators and error handling. |
| [2. File Organizer Utility](./02-file-organizer/) | File system operations, Directory traversal, File metadata, Pattern matching, String operations | Create a CLI tool that organizes files in a directory based on their type, size, or custom rules. |
| [3. Log Analyzer Tool](./03-log-analyzer/) | File reading and processing, Regular expressions, Text parsing and manipulation, Date/time handling, Data aggregation and statistics | Create a CLI tool that parses and analyzes log files to extract useful information, patterns, and statistics. |
| [4. JSON Configuration Validator](./04-json-validator/) | JSON parsing and manipulation, Struct definitions and tags, Validation and error handling, File I/O operations, Schema validation patterns | Create a CLI tool that validates JSON configuration files against predefined schemas and rules. |
| [5. Port Scanner Utility](./05-port-scanner/) | Network programming, Concurrency, Timeout handling, Parallel processing, Command-line argument parsing | Create a network port scanner that checks for open ports on target hosts using TCP connections. |
| [6. Directory Size Analyzer](./06-dir-sizer/) | File system navigation, Recursive directory traversal, Human-readable formatting, Data sorting and aggregation, Memory-efficient processing | Create a tool that analyzes disk usage by directory, showing which directories consume the most space. |
| [7. Simple Web Server with Templates](./07-web-server/) | HTTP server programming, HTML templates, Static file serving, HTTP routing and handlers, Request handling and form processing | Create a web server that serves dynamic content using HTML templates and static files. |
| [8. Exercise Index Generator Tool](./08-index-generator/) | Directory traversal and analysis, Markdown generation, File parsing and content extraction, Template-based content generation, Metadata extraction from structured content | Create a tool that automatically generates the main README.md index by scanning all exercise directories and extracting their metadata. |
| [9. Testing Fundamentals and TDD](./09-testing-fundamentals/) | Go testing framework, Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, Unit testing and test organization, Mocking and test doubles, Benchmark testing, Table-driven tests, Test coverage and reporting | Learn Go's testing framework by building a simple library with comprehensive tests using Test-Driven Development (TDD). |
| [10. File Watcher](./10-file-watcher/) | File system monitoring, Time-based operations, Event-driven programming, Concurrent operations, Signal handling, Pattern matching | Create a file system watcher that monitors directories for changes and triggers actions when files are created, modified, or deleted. |
## üöÄ Getting Started

Each exercise follows this structure:
- **Folder**: Contains the complete exercise in its own directory
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step guide to build the tool
- **Focus Areas**: Key Go concepts and standard library packages you'll learn
- **Solution**: Complete implementation for reference

## üìñ How to Use These Exercises

1. **Follow the Order**: Exercises build on previous concepts
2. **Read the Instructions First**: Understand what you're building
3. **Try It Yourself**: Write the code before looking at solutions
4. **Experiment**: Modify the tools to add your own features
5. **Build on Them**: Combine tools or extend them for new use cases

## üõ† Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or later installed
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Text editor or IDE
- Terminal/command line
- (Optional) [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) for automated builds and validation

### üöÄ Quick Start with Task

If you have Task installed, you can quickly validate all exercises:

```bash
# Install Task (if needed)
brew install go-task  # macOS
curl -sL https://taskfile.dev/install.sh | sh  # Linux

# Validate all exercises build correctly
task validate

# Run tests (currently testing exercise only)
task test

# Get help with all commands
task --list
```


## üìù Tips for Success

- **Read Error Messages**: Go's error messages are helpful
- **Use the Standard Library**: Avoid external packages unless specified
- **Test as You Go**: Run your code frequently to catch issues early
- **Read the Docs**: When stuck, check the Go documentation for the relevant package
